# **Churn Analysis of Customers using Excel and Power BI**  
👨‍💻 *Authored by Abhinav Dubey*  


## Hello Welcome to my Churn Analysis of Customer's project. I used Power BI Desktop and Excel to find patterns and trends to help businesses prevent customer loss and improve customer service.

## **Main Features:**
📌 **Churn Prediction**: Detect customers likely to leave and take proactive steps to retain them.  

📌 **Customer Segmentation**: Categorize customers by common traits and churn risk for targeted marketing and engagement.
